# BSc-Dissertation-Voice-Activated-Wireless-Home-System-

Designed a voice-activated wireless home system in a Three (3) man team. This project activates or 
deactivates basic home appliances with voice commands, one can think of it as a replacement for an 
on/off switch. This was aimed at making life more convenient for some physically challenged in the 
society, example the blind and the crippled.

Two microcontrollers, microcontroller 1 and 2 were used. Wireless communication was established 
between two wireless communication devices (Transmitter and Receiver). One of wireless communication 
device connects with microcontroller 1working as the transmitter to transmit the signal. The other 
wireless communication device is connected to microcontroller 2 to be the receiver. At microcontroller 
1 which becomes the transmitter part, there is a microphone and a voice recognition system which can 
receive and store the voice signal. When a voice command is given, the microphone and the voice 
recognition system get it first and then microcontroller 1 receives it. By the controlling program, 
microcontroller 1 will send the signal to the wireless transmitter. When the transmitter is enabled, 
it will send the corresponding signal to the wireless receiver. The receiver will send instructions 
to microcontroller 2 to turn a device (light) on or off enabled by a switching system.
